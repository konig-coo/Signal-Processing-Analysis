Binary Motor Imagery Classification, UCSD Kaggle Neural Data Challenge
This project attempts to classify left-right-handed motor imagery data using five feature processing techniques, three supervised learning algorithms, and two unsupervised heuristics.
For more detail, see the Abstract, Data, and Methods sections.
